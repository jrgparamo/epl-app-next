# Score Modal Implementation

## Overview

This implementation replaces the traditional number input fields with a custom modal that opens when users want to predict match scores. The modal is designed to be mobile-friendly and provides a better user experience.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Team-Branded Design

- Each modal uses the team's primary color as the background
- Automatically adjusts text color for optimal contrast
- Team logo is displayed prominently in the modal header

### ðŸ“± Mobile-Optimized

- **No Keyboard Auto-Open**: Uses buttons instead of input fields to prevent mobile keyboards from appearing unexpectedly
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger touch targets (48px minimum) for better accessibility
- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides subtle vibration feedback on supported devices
- **Gesture Support**: Active scale animations for better touch feedback

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart User Flow

- **Sequential Selection**: After selecting a score for one team, the modal automatically opens for the opposing team
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of which scores have been selected
- **Instant Save**: Predictions are saved immediately when both scores are selected

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Components

- **ScoreModal.js**: Main modal component with team colors and score selection
- **MatchCard.js**: Updated to use modal instead of input fields

#### Key Features

- **Team Color Mapping**: Comprehensive color palette for all Premier League teams
- **Contrast Calculation**: Automatic text color adjustment based on background luminance
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard support (ESC to close) and proper focus management
- **Performance**: Optimized animations and transitions

#### Mobile Enhancements

- `touch-manipulation` CSS for better touch response
- `WebkitTapHighlightColor: transparent` to remove iOS tap highlights
- Body scroll prevention when modal is open
- Minimum 48px touch targets following accessibility guidelines
