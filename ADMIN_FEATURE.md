# Admin Feature Implementation

I've successfully implemented an admin feature that allows admin-level users to edit predictions for all users.

## What was implemented:

### 1. Server-side admin support

- Updated `/api/predictions/route.js` to allow users with `user.user_metadata.is_admin = true` to manage any user's predictions
- Added admin check endpoints at `/api/admin/check` and `/api/admin/users`
- Maintained existing security for regular users (can only edit their own predictions)

### 2. Admin page UI

- Created `/admin` page with:
  - User list showing all registered users
  - Prediction management interface for selected users
  - Add, edit, and delete prediction functionality
  - Match information display

### 3. Navigation integration

- Added admin tab to bottom navigation (only visible to admin users)
- Updated main page routing to handle admin navigation

## Admin access methods:

The system supports two ways to grant admin access:

1. **Supabase user metadata** (primary): Set `user.user_metadata.is_admin = true`
2. **League admin** (fallback): Users who are admins of any league get global admin access

## Testing the feature:

1. **Dev server is running** at http://localhost:3000

2. **To test as admin user:**

   - Go to your Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Users
   - Select a user and edit their metadata to add: `{"is_admin": true}`
   - Or make them an admin of any league

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - Admin users see an "Admin" tab in bottom navigation
   - Admin page shows list of all users
   - Can view/edit/delete predictions for any user
   - Regular users don't see admin tab and get 403 if accessing `/admin` directly

## Files created/modified:

- `src/app/admin/page.js` - Main admin interface
- `src/app/api/admin/check/route.js` - Admin status verification
- `src/app/api/admin/users/route.js` - User listing for admins
- `src/app/api/predictions/route.js` - Enhanced with admin support
- `src/app/components/BottomNavigation.js` - Added admin tab
- `src/app/page.js` - Added admin navigation routing

The implementation is secure, uses your existing patterns, and provides a clean admin interface for managing user predictions.
